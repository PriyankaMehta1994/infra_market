			<center><h3>Transforming An Industry</h3></center><br><br>
			<p>Construction companies traditionally invest less than 1% of revenue in new technologies—lower than every other major industry. As a result, the last several decades have seen the construction productivity remain stagnant while the costs continue to go up.
			<br><br>
			We believe that the multi-billion dollar Indian construction industry is ready for change.
			<br><br>
			We are ready to do better.
			<br><br>
			We are bringing the technology, design, and supply chain innovations that revolutionized Silicon Valley to the world of infrastructure and construction.</p>
